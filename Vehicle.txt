Sure, let's create a lesson where you'll implement classes and methods in Java. We won't give you the exact code but will provide guidance on the task.

Task: Create a class hierarchy representing different types of vehicles with their top speed and number of wheels. Implement methods to display the vehicle's details.

Requirements:

Create a base class Vehicle with properties for top speed and number of wheels.
Implement a constructor for the Vehicle class that takes two arguments (top speed and number of wheels) and sets the properties accordingly.
Create a method displayDetails in the Vehicle class that prints the vehicle's top speed and number of wheels.
Create two subclasses, Car and Motorcycle, that inherit from the Vehicle class.
Implement constructors for the Car and Motorcycle classes that take top speed and number of wheels as arguments and pass them to the superclass constructor.
Override the displayDetails method in each subclass to provide a specific message for each vehicle type, including the top speed and number of wheels.
Hints:

Use the extends keyword to create subclasses.
Use the super keyword to call the superclass constructor from a subclass constructor.
Use the @Override annotation to indicate that you're overriding a method in a subclass.
Once you've implemented the classes and methods, create a main method to test your implementation. Instantiate a Car and a Motorcycle object, and call their displayDetails methods. Share your code, and I'll provide feedback!
